        <h2>Mid Game Guide</h2>
        <p>
            For the mid-game, I recommend buying the enchanted gear from the wandering traders, as you will need to
            defeat
            the <strong>Ender Dragon</strong> for the Draconic Evolution power storage (covered in Generating More
            Power).
        </p>
        <p>
            To get to the End, you'll need to craft an <strong>End Cake</strong>, and the questbook recommends making
            some
            <strong>Waystones</strong>, as these will grant you easy access back and forth to the End.

        <h2 class="accordion-header" id="mid-power">Generating More Power</h2>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                In the mid game, you'll encounter blocks and higher-tier items that will require more power than you're
                currently generating. More power is absolutely essential; however, it does come at the cost of being
                somewhat tedious, depending on which mod you choose. In this section, we'll explore a tedious mod and
                two others.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>More of Powah</strong> gives you higher energy transfer rates and ways of moving power
                wirelessly. There are seven different tiers of Powah: Start, Basic, Hardened, Blazing, Niotic, Spirited,
                and Nitro. Creating the tiered items is easy if the setup is correct. Hardened requires one Iron ingot
                and one Gold ingot, Blazing requires either a blaze rod or four blaze powder, Niotic requires one
                Diamond, Spirited requires one Emerald, and finally, Nitro requires one Nether Star, two blocks of
                redstone, and one block of Blazing Crystal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upgrading your <strong>Ender Cells</strong> and <strong>Ender Gates</strong> will be needed. The Cells
                allow for more channels of power (each channel will require an <strong>Energy Cell</strong>), and the
                Gates will have higher power transfer. I also recommend upgrading your <strong>Thermo
                    Generators</strong> since they will generate more power. Additionally, if you're using energy pipes
                from Mekanism, you can easily upgrade them to <strong>Elite Cables</strong> for better power throughput.
            </p>
            <p>
                For better power production, you'll want to use <strong>Bigger Reactors</strong>. By combining their
                reactors with turbines, you can generate passive and substantial power. This combination will easily set
                you up for the rest of the game. Bigger Reactors, when used properly, provide scalable and sustainable
                power that can support all your power-hungry needs in the late game. Their flexibility makes them an
                excellent choice for continued growth and automation.
            </p>
            <p>
                For power storage, delve a little into <strong>Draconic Evolution</strong>, as it offers tiered power
                storage solutions. Setting this up requires going to the <strong>End</strong>, where you'll need to
                gather valuable resources and craft large amounts of redstone blocks. Once you have the required
                materials, you can build powerful energy storage systems that can store vast amounts of power for later
                use. These systems are incredibly efficient and will ensure you never run out of power, even during
                intense periods of resource processing or automation.

                There are two mid-game storage options; the one explored on this page is <strong>Refined
                    Storage</strong>, and the other is <strong>Applied Energistics 2</strong>. Refined Storage is
                simpler and less power-hungry. The main components consist of a <strong>Controller</strong>,
                <strong>Disk Drive</strong>, and a <strong>Crafting Grid</strong>. This mod features storage drives,
                each of which increases storage capacity, though there are different tiers of drives, with higher-tier
                drives offering larger storage capacities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The autocrafter in this mod simplifies crafting, removing the tedium associated with this and other
                mods. It can also be placed behind a furnace or other processing blocks for easier crafting. The
                autocrafter requires patterns, which are created in the <strong>Pattern Grid</strong> and then placed
                into the autocrafter. Refined Storage also integrates with <strong>Functional Storage</strong> through
                an <strong>External Storage</strong> cable, and it offers wireless crafting and storage.

            <p>
                <strong>Mystical Agriculture</strong> is highly recommended as you're able to grow majority of the items
                in the game. Once again there are multiple tiers of farmland and seeds, the tiers are reflected by the
                essence that is used to make the seed. If you go down the Refined Storage path for storage, then get
                <strong>Silicon Seeds</strong> and <strong>Quartz Enriched Iron Seeds</strong> the storage parts require
                a lot of Silicon, and the blocks and storage parts need Quartz Enriched Iron.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you plant the correct tiered seeds in the same tier farmland there's an 11% chance of getting an
                extra seed with each harvest. This modpack allows you to grow items by sneaking (default Shift-key) and
                it has FTB Ultimine which when pressing <strong>`</strong> lets you left-click or right-click a section
                of blocks as long as their the same. With this combination, you can spam sneak while holding down the
                Ultimine key and rapidly right-click to quickly harvest many seeds.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Mob Grinding Utils</strong> allows you to spawn and kill mobs. Hostile mobs spawn on
                <strong>Dreadful Dirt</strong> and peaceful mobs spawn on <strong>Delightful Dirt</strong>. With
                Delightful Dirt, it's recommended to have a <strong>Dispencer</strong> with a Water Bucket and a way to
                activate and deactivated it, as Delightful Dirt generates grass and flowers, which prevents mobs from
                spawning.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Dreadful Dirt</strong> combined with <strong>Fans</strong>, an <strong>Absorption
                    Hopper</strong>, and a way to kill the mobs either with a <strong>Mob Masher</strong> or
                <strong>Iron Spikes</strong> you can farm hostile mob drops, allowing for easier crafting.
            </p>

        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>
                To help with processing there's ways you can automate things. This section covers automating reactor
                input, Mystical Agriculture seed output, Smithing Template (Netherite), mob farm drops and Mystical
                Agriculture growing.
            </p>
            <p>
                To help with reactor input you can use an <strong>Ender Chest</strong> to transport the
                <strong>Uranium</strong> into the reactor with the use of either <strong>Pipez</strong> or
                <strong>Mekanism</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mystical Agriculture seeds output essence, which is then crafted into the desired item. This process can
                be fully automated using a Crafter Tier 3 from RFTools, combined with LaserIO to automatically route and
                craft the essences into the final items.
            </p>
            <p>
                Netherite Templates can be sought from <strong>Occultism's Possessed Hoglins</strong> and
                <strong>Bastions</strong> in the Nether. With the Possessed Hoglins you can use a Mob Swab from
                <strong>Mob Grinding Utils</strong> to get <strong>GM Chicken Feed</strong> then feed it to a chicken to
                get a Possessed Hoglin mob egg. Using this and a <strong>Entity Spawner</strong>, <strong>XP
                    Solidifier</strong>, and a <strong>XP Jelly Baby</strong> you can keep spawning mob from mob eggs
                within configurable space.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the mob farm you can automate the sorting of the drops (mob loot) by using <strong>Create's Belts,
                    Funnels, Tunnels and Item Filters</strong>. However, you can also store it in one Barrel from
                <strong>Sophisticated Stroage</strong> using their <strong>Stack and Void Upgrades</strong>. Once you
                have enough storage space you can put the items straight into your storage if you wish.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Mystical Agriculture growing, there are two ways to automatically grow the seeds. One is using
                <strong>Lilypad of Fertility</strong>, which requires water and placing the Lilypads under the
                farmland block. The other way (more expensive) is by using <strong>Supremium Growth
                    Accelerator</strong>, which can be stacked up to 60 blocks from underneath the farmland to
                accelerate growth. To harvest the seeds, use a <strong>Harvest Pylon</strong>. Set the spacing in the
                interface and place Hoes into the available slots. I'd recommend using either a <strong>Supremium
                    Hoe</strong> for better durability or keeping an eye on it and topping it up with Hoes, as the Pylon
                uses durability with each harvest.
