    <h2 id="crook">Crook</h2>
    <p>
        To get started, you'll need to begin by punching wood to obtain logs. With the wood you've gathered, craft a
        <strong>Crafting Table</strong> and then a <strong>Crook</strong>.
        Re-grow your tree and use the Crook to harvest the leaves. It may take a few tries, but eventually, you'll
        obtain one or two <strong>Silkworms</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you have Silkworms, re-grow another tree and right-click leaves with the Silkworms in hand. Wait
        for the leaves to become fully infested (they'll turn white).
        Once fully infested, harvest the leaves with your Crook — this will give you
        <strong>String</strong>, which is essential for crafting the <strong>String Meshes</strong> required for
        your <strong>Sieve</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        To obtain <strong>Cobblestone</strong>, right-click grass with an empty hand to gather
        <strong>Pebbles</strong>. Combine four Pebbles in a 2x2 crafting grid to create one Cobblestone block.
        While this method can feel tedious early on, it's essential for progressing in the pack. I recommend
        making a <strong>Dank</strong> as it will filter out the other pebbles.
    </p>

    <h2 class="accordion-header" id="sieving">Sieving</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            To begin gathering sievable materials, you'll first need a <strong>Hammer</strong>. Craft one by
            combining two sticks and two cobblestones. Once crafted, place a cobblestone block on the ground and use
            the hammer to break it down into <strong>Gravel</strong>. Gravel is your primary sieving material early
            on. Right-click the sieve repeatedly to process the gravel and reveal items.
        </p>
        <p>
            To improve your sieve's efficiency, upgrade to a <strong>Flint Mesh</strong>. Craft this by combining a
            String Mesh with four pieces of flint. This upgrade increases your chances of obtaining valuable ore
            chunks. Once you have enough resources, I highly recommend progressing to <strong>Iron Meshes</strong>
            and eventually <strong>Golden Meshes</strong>. Golden Meshes significantly boost your odds of receiving
            rare
            drops like <strong>Diamonds</strong> and <strong>Emeralds</strong> when sieving <strong>Gravel</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you've established a basic power setup, you can automate this process using a <strong>Cobblestone
                Generator</strong>, <strong>Flux Hammer</strong>, and <strong>Flux Sieve</strong>. This system
            allows you to passively generate sieved resources while focusing on other parts of your base. For full
            automation, you'll want to integrate a <strong>Tier 3 Crafter</strong> (RFTools Utility), a
            <strong>Mechanical Squeezer</strong> for ore doubling, a <strong>Furnace</strong> (see below), and
            upgraded storage such as a <strong>Gold Chest</strong>, or a <strong>Gold Barrel</strong> with item
            collection.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Tip:</em> I recommend upgrading your furnace early — a <strong>Gold Furnace</strong> or
            <strong>Diamond Furnace</strong> will dramatically speed up your smelting rates and keep up with
            automated input.

    <h2 class="accordion-header" id="early-power">Generating Early Power</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            In the early stages of <strong>ATM9 To The Sky</strong>, setting up a basic power system is crucial for
            beginning automation. <strong>Mekanism</strong> offers the <strong>Heat Generator</strong>, which runs
            on lava and is easy to set up using your early crucible setup. Alternatively, <strong>RFTools
                Power</strong> provides the <strong>Coal Generator</strong>, which uses burnable fuel like coal or
            charcoal. Both are compact and effective starter options.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you've placed your generator, you can power nearby machines directly or use basic cables to
            distribute energy more efficiently. <strong>Universal Cables</strong> (Mekanism) and <strong>Energy
                Pipes</strong> (Pipez) are easy to craft and ideal for connecting machines like <strong>Flux
                Hammers</strong>, <strong>Sieves</strong>, or even early <strong>Iron Furnaces</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A strong upgrade from there is the <strong>Wind Generator</strong> from Mekanism. It provides a steady
            and renewable energy source that performs best at higher altitudes (Y > 128 is ideal). Wind Generators
            are a great long-term solution for powering multiple early automation blocks.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the setup shown, nine <strong>Wind Generators</strong> are used to fully power a suite of machines —
            including <strong>Flux Hammers</strong>, <strong>Flux Sieves</strong>, a <strong>Tier 3 Crafter</strong>
            (RFTools Utility), a <strong>Mechanical Squeezer</strong>, and a <strong>Furnace</strong> with a
            <strong>Factory Upgrade</strong>. However, for simple gravel sieving, even one Wind Generator is often
            enough to get started.
        </p>
        <p>
            To prevent power loss during automation, consider using two <strong>Thermo Generators</strong> from
            <strong>Powah</strong>, each producing a stable power output. Connect both to an <strong>Ender
                Cell</strong>, which acts as a remote energy storage and transfer system. From there, you can link
            the Ender Cell to your power network using <strong>Basic Universal Cables</strong> (Mekanism) or
            <strong>Energy Pipes</strong> (Pipez). This ensures that your machines remain powered even if one
            generator goes offline or you expand your system later.
        </p>

    <h2 class="accordion-header" id="cobble-gen">Creating a Cobblestone Generator</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            Craft a <strong>Cobblestone Generator (Tier 1)</strong> using six wooden logs, one bucket of water, one
            bucket of lava, and a glass block. Once placed, it will passively generate cobblestone and automatically
            insert it into an inventory placed directly on top. A <strong>Storage Drawer</strong> is ideal here — it
            holds 2,048 cobblestone by default, and its capacity can be upgraded later with <strong>Storage
                Upgrades</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get water early, place an <strong>Oak Barrel</strong> outdoors and let it fill when it rains. Once it
            rains,create an <strong>infinite water source</strong> by digging a 2x2 hole and filling opposite
            corners with water. This ensures you always have access to a renewable water supply.
        </p>
        <p>
            To produce lava, you'll need a <strong>Porcelain Crucible</strong> placed over a heat source — a torch
            works, but using a <strong>Campfire</strong> or <strong>Magma Block</strong> will significantly speed up
            the melting rate. Feed the crucible with cobblestone until it accumulates 1,000 mB of lava, then extract
            it using a bucket. This lava is essential for crafting your cobble generator or powering early Heat
            Generators from <strong>Mekanism</strong>.

    <h2 class="accordion-header" id="early-resources">Generating Resources</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            Early resource generation is built around <strong>Sieving</strong> and <strong>Mystical
                Agriculture</strong>. Once you've gathered enough <strong>Inferium Essence</strong> from mob drops,
            you can craft <strong>Inferium Seeds</strong> and plant them in regular farmland. These seeds passively
            produce Inferium, which you'll use to progress through the mystical essence tiers.
        </p>
        <p>
            To fully automate essence crafting, combine <strong>LaserIO</strong> (Laser Node + Item Cards),
            <strong>Basic Item Collector</strong>, <strong>Storage Drawers or Barrels</strong>, <strong>Item
                Pipes</strong>, and a <strong>Crafter Tier 3</strong> from <strong>RFTools Utility</strong>. This
            setup can automatically convert lower-tier essences into higher ones, eventually giving you access to
            <strong>Supremium Essence</strong> and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
            A functional <strong>Mob Tower</strong> is key before entering mid-game. Many advanced recipes rely on
            mob drops, especially for essence farming. Using <strong>Mob Grinding Utils</strong>, you can build a
            reliable, compact system using <strong>Fans</strong> to push mobs and an <strong>Absorption
                Hopper</strong> to collect drops and XP. You don't need <strong>Dreadful Dirt</strong> at this
            stage.
        </p>
        <p>
            To obtain <strong>Soul Sand</strong> early, drop <strong>Sand</strong> into a barrel of <strong>Witch
                Water</strong>. To make Witch Water, you'll need <strong>Mycelium</strong> — acquired by sieving
            dirt to find <strong>Mycelium Spores</strong>. Right-click a dirt block with spores to start the spread.
            &#10071;<em>Tip:</em> Mycelium spreads fast, so isolate it from your grass or dirt-based
            farms.
        </p>
        <p>
            Place an <strong>Oak Barrel</strong> on top of a Mycelium block, then fill it with water. Wait for the
            water to transform into Witch Water, then right-click with sand to convert it into Soul Sand. Once
            you've got your first block, you can automate this process using the <strong>Create</strong> mod.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Create-based automation, set up a <strong>Water Wheel</strong> or other rotational source, connect
            it to an <strong>Encased Fan</strong> facing a <strong>Depot</strong>, and place <strong>Soul
                Fire</strong> (Soul Sand + Flint & Steel) between the fan and depot. Drop sand on the depot and let
            the fan convert it into Soul Sand over time. This loop is entirely passive and great for scaling later
            mystical farming or Nether Quartz generation.

    <h2 class="accordion-header" id="sievable">Sievable Blocks</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>
            <strong>Xycraft's Extractor</strong> allows you to create valuable blocks like
            <strong>Blackstone</strong>, <strong>Deepslate</strong>, <strong>End Stone</strong>,
            <strong>Moss</strong>, and <strong>Mud</strong>. These blocks can be processed further to obtain unique
            resources through sieving and hammering chains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most of these materials — like Blackstone and End Stone — can be piped directly into a <strong>Flux
                Hammer</strong> to be crushed into their respective fragments, which are then sent into a
            <strong>Flux Sieve</strong> for processing. <strong>Moss</strong> doesn't need to be hammered and can be
            piped straight into a sieve.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Mud</strong>, however, requires a different approach. First, pipe the mud into a
            <strong>Mechanical Squeezer</strong> (or standard Squeezer if you're doing it manually) to convert it
            into <strong>Dirt</strong>. That dirt can then be sieved for various early-game items like seeds,
            mycelium spores, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            For standard materials like <strong>Gravel</strong>, <strong>Sand</strong>, and <strong>Dust</strong>,
            you can automate production using <strong>Cobble For Days</strong> generators. Pipe cobblestone into a
            <strong>Flux Hammer</strong> to get gravel, then into a second hammer to get sand, and finally into a
            third hammer to produce dust — each stage requiring its own Flux Hammer. From there, send the processed
            material into the corresponding sieve.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also fully automate <strong>Soul Sand</strong> production using <strong>Create</strong>. Start
            by hammering cobblestone down to sand, then pipe it onto a <strong>Create Depot</strong>. To the side of
            the depot, place a block of <strong>Soul Fire</strong> (Soul Sand lit with Flint and Steel), and have a
            <strong>Fan</strong> blow over it to convert the sand into Soul Sand. Once transformed, use a
            <strong>Mechanical Belt</strong> or chute to carry the Soul Sand into a barrel or directly into a sieve.
